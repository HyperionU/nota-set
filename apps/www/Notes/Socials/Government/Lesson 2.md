## Lesson 2: The Legislative Branch 

---
## Components of the Branch:

* King
    * **Govenor General**
* **Senate**
* **House of Commons**
    * Government Party
        * Prime Minister
        * Cabinet
        * Backbenchers
    * Opposition
        * Shadow Cabinet

---

## The Govenor General

* Gives the **Speech from the Throne** (Speech prepared by the PM's Office, outlining goals of the gov't in the next session.)
* **Royal Assent** (Approves a bill to make it law.)
* **Dissolution** (Ends a session of Parliament, and starts an election. Done on the advice of the PM.)

---

## The Senate (The Upper House)

* The purpose is:
    * Provide **regional representation** (equal # from each region)
    * Provide **"sober second thought"** to legislation (check and balance on HoC)
* Cannot introduce bills requiring spending money, so bills almost never come from the senate.

---

## The Senate, Continued

* Consists of 105 senators **appointed by the PM**, & serve until 75, resignation or death.
* When the PM appoints a friend or supporter, it is known as "Patronage"

---

## Senate Reform

* Many consider the senate ineffective, not democratic, and basically a "rubber stamp" that always approves bills from the HoC.

---

## Senate Reform, Continued

* **Triple "E" Senate** - "Elected, Effective, Equal"
    * Each Province elects the same number of senators (requires amendment of Constitution)
* **The Panel Senate**
    * Each Province elects a panel of candidates, allowing the PM to choose one (no amendment needed)

---

## The House of Commons (Lower House)

* Filled with 338 elected representatives, or MP's (**Members of Parliament**)
* Provides **"Representation By Population"** (each MP represents approx. 111k Canadians)
* Most bills originate in the House of Commons.

---

## HoC, Continued

* **The Speaker**, a respected member elected from the house, acts as a chairperson and referee during debate.
    * Can break voting ties.
* **The Government** sits to the right of the speaker.
    * PM and their **Cabinet** sit in front rows,
    * Other members are called **Backbenchers**.
* The opposition sits opposite to the government, and has a **Shadow Cabinet** to offer specialised scrutiny of Cabinet policy and actions.

---

## Committees

* Cannot change the purpose of legislation, but does work refining and polishing the language of the bill.
* MP's from all parties make up members of the committees.
* Types of Committees:
    * Committees of the Whole - full HoC examines a bill
    * Standing Committees - Committees that meet seperately.

## Law-Making Process, Part 1

1) A bill is introduced, usually by a **cabinet member** in the **House of Commons**.
2) The bill goes through **First Reading <i class="fa-solid fa-file-lines" style="color: green;"></i>**, where it's simply introduced
3) In the **Second Reading <i class="fa-solid fa-file-circle-question" style="color: green;"></i>**, it is debated and voted on (to decide whether to continue).
4) If approved, the bill moves to **Committee<i class="fa-solid fa-people-line" style="color: green;"></i>**, where it is polished and refined.
5) At the **Third Reading<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll" style="color: green;"></i>**, The House votes, if approved, it moves to the **Senate<i class="fa-solid fa-diagram-next" style="color:red"></i>**.

---

## Law Making Process, Part 2

6) In the Senate, the bill goes through **First Reading <i class="fa-solid fa-file-lines" style="color: red;"></i>, Second Reading <i class="fa-solid fa-file-circle-question" style="color: red;"></i>, Committee <i class="fa-solid fa-people-line" style="color:red;"></i>** and a **Third Reading<i class="fa-solid fa-scroll" style="color: red;"></i>**.
7) ***If*** both the the House and Senate pass the bill, it is sent to the **Govenor General**, whom gives it **Royal Assent<i class="fa-brands fa-canadian-maple-leaf" style="color: blue;"></i>**, and it *finally* becomes a ***Law***.
