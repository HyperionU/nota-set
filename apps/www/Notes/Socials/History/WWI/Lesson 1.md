# Lesson 1: Causes of The First World War

---

## Causes:

* The First World War wasn't fought for clear reasons. 
* It was the result of a multitude of contributing factors. 
* Generally, it is accepted there were 4 MAIN Causes of the War:
    * Militarism
    * Alliance Network
    * Imperialism
    * Nationalism

---

## Militarism

* An attitude where the military is used as a means to solve problems or disputes.
* Often referred to as "Sabre Rattling"
    * Prior to the war, Britain and Germany had been involved in a frantic **arms race.** It was largely naval, as both produced larger battleships. Naval power ensured countries could support and defend colonies.
    * Many conflicts were resolved through posturing a show of force: *"Gunboat Diplomacy"*.

---

## Imperialism

* The attitude whereby a country builds an empire to increase its own strength and wealth.
    * Germany was racing to build a colonial empire, putting them at odds with Britain.
    * Many countries raced to develop holdings in Africa and the Pacific. Pride caused many conflicts and disputes.
    * Britain claimed, "The sun never sets on the British Empire."

---

## Alliances

* A series of secret and public treaties to protect countries. Although defensive, they ensured once hostilities erupted, **all** of Europe would be dragged in.
    * Triple Entente (Allies) - Britain, France & Russia
    * Triple Aliance (Central) - Germany, Austria-Hungary & Italy
    * Even when countries attempted to stay out of conflict, treaties & alliances dragged them in (spiral into absolute war).

---

## Nationalism

* A strong sense of pride in one's culture and ethnic background. Can, but does not have to refer to one's "country".
    * Major Powers were Ultra-nationalistic (nationalistic to the point of supremacy). They were considered "Jingoistic" (self-obsessed, super patriotic, flag waving, etc.)
    * Countries sharing a linguistic, ethnic or cultural link felt an allegiance to each other. (Nationalism encourages Alliances).
