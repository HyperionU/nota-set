# Lesson 2.1: Canada's Army

---

## Canada's Army at Onset of WWI

* $3000$ Poorly trained soldiers, tiny navy, no artillery.
* Most used Ross Rifle, which was laughably awful:
    * Jammed under field conditions
    * Replaced with Lee-Enfield
* Some regiments even wore kilts
    * Many Canadians were of Scottish Heritage.

---

## The Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF)
* $32000$ strong, first overseas expeditionary force.
    * The people were very naive,
    * "Home by Christmas"
        * British statement, belief it was a short, decisive victory.
    * Many were afraid the war was over by the time they got overseas.

---

## Propaganda

* A message "designed to encourage the recipient to alter their attitudes / behaviour to coincide with that of the sender."
    * Often used in times of war, campaigns for elections,
    * Most common form: Advertising

---

# Lesson 2.2: Canada's Response

---

## The Response

* August 4, 1914 - PM Borden's Government drafted a War Measures Act
    * Gave them stronger powers to act
    * Only used twice, before rebranding as the Emergencies Act
* Liberals pledged a political truce
* Many hoped this would unite the English and French.
* By September, there were $32,000$ volunteers

---

## The Response, cont.

* Everyone expected the war to be over by Christmas.
* It sounded like a great adventure to many young men.
* Soon, enthusiasm faded. The war would obviously last past Christmas.
* French Canadians were opposed to fighting a war for the British.
