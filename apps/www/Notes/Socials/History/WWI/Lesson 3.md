## Lesson 3.1: The Opening Move

---

## The Schlieffen Plan

* The Germans were faced with a 2 front war with both France & Russia
* Their solution: The Schlieffen Plan
    * The weakest German units hold along the French Border (Rhineland)
    * The strongest German units attack through Belgium, moving quickly to attack Paris from behind.
    * With France defeated, Germany could turn and attack Russia.

---

## Problems with The Schlieffen Plan

* Assumed Belgium would not fight.
    * The Belgians did fight, slowing progress.
* Assumed Britain wouldn't honour a treaty guaranteeing Belgium's neutrality.
    * Britain honoured the treaty, meaning France & Britain would fight together.
* Assumed Russia's mobilisation was slow.
    * Russia mobilised in **10** days.

---

## Results of The Schileffen Plan

* Because of it's shortcomings, the German offensive stalled.
* Faced with a retreat, the Generals insisted on digging defensive trenches to hold parts of France and Belgium they already took.

---

## Lesson 3.2: Trench Warfare

---

## Trench Warfare

* Allies realised they couldn't break through German lines.
* They were forced to dig opposing trenches, often in lowlands.
* Many hit ground water and were very muddy. Allies lived in the worst conditions, with soldiers often getting "Trench Foot".
* Trenches & ground rarely changed hands.
* It became a war of attrition.

---

## WWI Trenches Info

* Trenches were never dug in straight lines.
* There were often three rows of trenches:
    * Front-Line: Limited Protection
    * Support: Supported the Front-Line
    * Reserve: Reserve for any other soldiers
* Machine guns and barbed wire (razor wire) protected the trenches.
* Between them was No Man's Land (churned up by shell fire, masses of mud), which was near impossible to cross.
