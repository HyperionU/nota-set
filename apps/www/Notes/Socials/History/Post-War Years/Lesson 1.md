# Lesson 1a: The Cold War

---

## The Allies, Pre-Cold War

* The Allied alliance was a marriage of convenience.
* Purpose to defeat a more aggressive and common enemy: Hitler & Nazism
* By the end of the war, Gr. Br. & Fr were no longer superpowers.
* There were now only "The Big Two": US & USSR.

---

## US v. USSR: The Cold War

* The US & USSR had vast resources and military forces at the end of WWII.
* Both were ideologically opposed: 
**Capitalism v Communism**
* Soviets desired a buffer between them & the west, while the west feared the massive Red army.
* Suspicions fueled tensions.
* International affairs had become polarized: The world was dominated by two ideologically opposed powers.

---

## The Cold War

* March 1946: Former PM Churchill warned of Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe in a speech to a US University:
* > From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the adriatic, an **Iron Curtain** has descended across the continent.
* This is seen as the start of *The Cold War*.

---

## Occurances during the Cold War

* The US & USSR would engage in a dangerous arms race, and compete for global, political & financial influence.
* Spin-off wars would be fought (i.e. Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan), but this would never result in direct conflict between the superpowers.

# Lesson 1b: Origins of the UN

---

## Peaceful Resolution, pre-UN

* The idea of nations using diplomacy to solve problems was not new.
* The League of Nations was a serious attempt at this. 
* It failed miserably.

---

## The Atlantic Charter

* Summer, 1941: Roosevelt and Churchill met aboard a ship off Newfoundland.
* They drafted an eight point document (*The Atlantic Charter*), which provided a rationale for the war and goal for peace afterwards.
* Stalin was not in support and did not sign.
* The Charter formed the foundation of the UN.

## The Points:

1. No territorial gains sought by the US or UK
2. Territorial changes must reflect the wishes of the People.
3. The Right to Self Determination
4. Trade barriers lowered
5. Economic cooperation & promotion of *Social Welfare*
6. Freedom from want and fear
7. Freedom of the seas
8. Disarmament, especially of aggressor nations.

---

## The UN Era

* Sept, 1945: 50 nations, including Canada, signed the United Nations Charter in San Francisco.
* The United Nations is a symbol of both the hope and need to avoid conflict and cooperate.
* Since its creation, it has seen both success and failure.

---

## UN's Sectors

* General Assembly: ALL members are a part, and draft and vote on resolutions
* Security Council: 15 Members, 5 permanent and 10 non-permanent, which serve for 2 years.
    * All Permanent Members were the first to develop Nuclear Weapons:
        * US, UK, Fr, USSR (Russia), China.
    * Only SC can authorise Military Force
    * **ALL Permanent** members have *Veto* Power.
