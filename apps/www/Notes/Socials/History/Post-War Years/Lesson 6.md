# Lesson 6: PM Pearson (1963-1968)

---

## The 60's (The Years of Culture)

* US influence grew as the number of TV's grew & pop culture spilled over into Canada.
* Ideas like "youth culture" & "civil rights" had wide appeal.
* Canada was infatuated with Kennedy's America.
* Pearson traveled to the US to meet with Kennedy to repair strained relations.

---

## Canada & the Vietnam War

* The improved relations didn't last, as Kennedy was assasinated & replaced by Lyndon B. Johnson.
* Under Johnson, America's war in Vietnam was growing, and Canadians were becoming more critical of the US.

---

## Canada v. America's Pressure

* 1965: The US was pressuring Canada to join the Vietnam War, but Pearson did not support the War.
* April, 1965: Pearson gives a speech at Temple University and spoke of the need for a negotiated settlement.
* Pres. Johnson, in a meeting the next day, grabbed Pearson by the lapels, and yelled, "You pissed on my rug!"
* It's fair to say that this was a low point in US-Can Relations
