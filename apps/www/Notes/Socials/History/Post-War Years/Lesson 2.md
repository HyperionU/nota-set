# Lesson 2: PM King (1945-1948)

---

## International Affairs: Spies in Canada

* Late 1945: Igor Gouzenko, a Soviet embassy clerb in Ottawa defected to Canada, revealing a Soviet spy ring in Canada.
* This was a shock and wake up call to the west.

## The Berlin Airlift (1948-1949)

* Germany was divided into Four Sectors (US, Br, Fr. & USSR)
* Berlin (in the Soviet Sector), was also divided into four zones.
* June, 1948: Soviets blockade rail and roadways into the Western zones of Berlin.
* The western powers could either:
    * Supply 2.5 million Berliners by air
    * Abandon the City
    * Send a convoy to open the blockade.

## The Vittles Operation

* 4500 Tonnes of food, coal & other resources were needed daily.
* Three airports were uses; planes landed continuously, in 3 minute intervals, 24/7. (*Imagine the coordination needed.*)
* Soviets harassed the aircraft, using jamming, drifting balloons and spotlights.

---

## The Conclusion

* The blockade lasted until May, 1949: Soviets gave in and allowed land routes to open.
* Canadian forces did not participate directly, but many Canadian pilots flew American planes during the crisis.
