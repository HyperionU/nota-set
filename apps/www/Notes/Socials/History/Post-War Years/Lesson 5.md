# Lesson 5: PM Diefenbaker (1957-63)

---

## The CF-105 Avro Arrow

* The Avro Arrow was a fighter jet developed and built by A. V. Roe (hence Avro), a Canadian avionics company.
* It was in the prototype stage, but had some problems:
    * Design Bugs
    * A. V. Roe's financial troubles
    * Over-budget
    * No foreign buyers

---

## The End for the Arrow

* 20 Feb, 1959 (Black Friday): PM Diefenbaker cancels the Arrow & orders all prototypes destroyed & cut into scrap.
* The Arrow would have made Canada a leader in aerospace technology, it was ahead of its time.
* The Arrow became a symbol of "what could have been" & Canada's "missed chance" to become a leader.

---

## The Bomarcs

* 1958: Dief agreed to deploy Bomarc missiles in Canada.
* However, within months Canada was shopping for used US fighters; (*There's a reason jets survived into the modern era.*) and Dief refused Nuclear Warheads on the Bomarcs, making them pointless.
* Dief was staunchly anti-Nuclear weaponry.

---

## US Foreign Policy

* Since Korea, Canada-US relationships were strained.
* Although he was suspicious of US influence in Canada, Dief was very anti-Communist.
* He had a respectful and positive relationship with US Pres. Eisenhower.
* The respect made it easier to cancel the Arrow (felt he had support from the US, *sort of*.)

---

## Cold War's Hottest Point (Preamble)

* Cuba, 1959 - Fidel Castro lead a revolution against US-friendly dictator, Batista.
* Castro was a nationalist & socialist.
* US anti-Socialist reaction drove Castro toward the USSR.
* 1960: Eisenhower loses the US election to Kennedy.
* Dief hated Kennedy. (young, rich, liberal)

---

## Cold War's Hottest Point (1962)

* 1961: US supported a failed Cuban invasion.
* Castro looked to the Soviets for protection.
* Oct, 1962: US discovers Soviet missile sights in Cuba.
* In response, the US sets up a naval blockade of Cuba.

---

## The Convoy's Game of Chicken

* A convoy of Soviet ships, steaming toward Cuba with missiles for the new sites.
* The world waited to see who would blink first.
* Would the Soviets turn around, or run the Blockade? (*Vote Now on your Phones*)
* The Soviets, at the last minute, turned around.

---

## Canada and the Cuban Missiles

* NORAD was on high alert.
* Dief didn't put Canadian sectors on alert, as requested by the US.
* Instead, Dief questioned the US reaction 
* Kennedy was very upset by Canada's response.
* 1962: Dief's majority fell to a minority.

---

## The End for Diefenbaker

* 1963: Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, the US called out Canada, claiming that Canada "has not yet proposed any significant contribution to the defense of North America."
* Pearson (Liberal Leader, *remember him?*), said he would accept nuclear warheads as part of Canada's obligation.
* April, 1963: Dief's gov't fell to Pearson's Liberals.
