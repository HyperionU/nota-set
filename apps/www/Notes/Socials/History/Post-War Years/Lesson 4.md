    * Pine Tree Line (above the border)
    * Mid-Canada Line (~1/2 way through Canada)
    * Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line - (Arctic)
    * US Military Personnel were stationed in Canada.

* Br, Fr. & Israel developed a plan for Israel to attack Egypt.
* After Israel beat Egypt back to the canal, the Br. & Fr. landed paratroopers, securing the canal.

---

## Suez Crisis: Cold War Warms

* There was one problem: Br. moved too fast, and the rest of the world realised they were all working together.
* USSR supported Egypt, threatening to drop atomic bombs on London & Paris.
* US promised to respond in kind.
* The US president was furious; he wasn't consulted by Br. or Fr.
* *This can't get worse, right?*

---

## Suez Crisis: It Gets Worse

* The US president *insisted* they withdraw; Br. & Fr. refuse.
* Nasser sunk ships loaded with concrete in the canal.
* Br. & Fr. were in an awkward position.
* Many Canadians wanted to support Br, but PM St. Laurent refused to support them.

---

## The UN Peacekeepers Intervine

* Canada's External Affairs Minister (*and future PM*), Lester Pearson proposes something different: **A UN Peacekeeping Force**.
* The force helped all sides save face.
* Pearson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in ending the crisis.
