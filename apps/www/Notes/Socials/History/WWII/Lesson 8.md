# Lesson 8: The War in Europe, Part II & III

---

## 8.1: Part II

---

## Dieppe: A Bloody 9 Hours

* Allied command felt a small scale attack would prove valuable
* It would test equipment, techniques and German defences
* The Second Canadian Division was chosen as the main attack force for an assault on the French Port town of Dieppe.

---

## Dieppe, cont.

* There were four diversionary attacks at other locations. 
* The main attack at Dieppe would be before dawn. 
* Supported by air cover and assisted by tanks landed on the beach.
* 19 Aug, 1942: Dieppe Raid begins.

---

## Dieppe's 9 Hours

* The ships were delayed, causing the troops to land in daylight.
* The Germans were alerted to their arrival.
* Gr. machine guns prevented soldiers from getting off the beach.
* Bad communications meant reinforcements were sent too soon
* Tanks were nearly immobilized by the pebbled beach.

---

## Aftermath

* 907 Canadians died, 586 were wounded and 1874 were taken prisoner.
* Attack was a failure, but not a complete loss.
* The Allies learned much about the German defenses and how they might make a more successful attack.
* Argued that these lessons made D-Day a success.

---

## Italy

* Nazis expanded territory as far as North Africa
* US, British and Commonwealth forces drove the Nazis out of N. Africa between 1942 & 1943
* Allies began to advance towards the continent
* Attacked the most vulnerable: the "Soft Underbelly" of Europe.

---

## Invasion of Italy

* 10 July, 1943: Canadians were part of the invasion of Sicily.
* By Sept, attacks shifted to the mainland.
* The advance was slow against bad weather and tough Germans.

---

## Ortona: Canada's "Stalingrad"

* The largest battle involving Canada was for the Italian town of Ortona.
* Canadians fought there for about a month, with a final assault on 20 Dec.
* Fighting was from house to house, through walls (Canada's first Urban Battle)
* 28 Dec, 1943: Ortona was taken by the Canadians, after such heavy losses it was known as the "Western Stalingrad"

---

## Italy's Defeat

* 4 June, 1944: Rome falls to the Allies
* Allies continued to push north, but events in Normandy would overshadow gains in Italy.

---

## 8.2: Part III: Overlord

---

## The Second Front

* 1944: Allies are ready to open a second front.
* After Dieppe, lessons had been learned and plans rehearsed.
* Extreme measures were taken to maintain the secret
* Gr. knew it would eventually happen, but didn’t know where, fortifying the entire coast, but expected the attack at Calais.
* Thousands of Allied soldiers waited for the signal.
* Weather, tides & poor moonlight delayed the attack
* 6 June, 1944: The Allies attack.

---

## The Landing

* Five landing beaches were designated on the Normandy coast.
1) Utah: US
2) Omaha: US
3) Gold: Br.
4) Juno: Canada
5) Sword: Br.
* The night before, Paratroopers landed in Normandy, artillery pounding the beaches.

---

## Juno: Canada's Beach

* Over 30,000 Canadians landed at Juno, 359 died and 715 wounded.
* With surprise on their side, they were successful in establishing a foothold, and began to push inland.

---

## Road to the Netherlands: Caen

* After Juno, the next major task for the Canadians was to continue to engage the enemy; then take the city of Caen.
* 9 Jul, 1944: they took Caen, but almost a month later than planned
* In taking Caen, they suffered higher losses than on D-Day.

---

## Road to the Netherlands: Beyond Caen

* Further advances beyond Caen brought more casualties.
* In one four day period, Canadians suffered 2,000 casualties.
* 25 Jul, 1944: Canada suffered 1500 casualties, 450 of them were deaths.
* After Dieppe, it was Canada’s
bloodiest day in the war.

---

## Road to the Netherlands: The Coast
* Canadians then moved north to clear the French port towns like Dieppe, Boulogne & Calais.
* British troops took the port of Antwerp, Belgium and Canadians were sent to secure the Scheldt estuaries (port access lanes).
* The Battle of the Scheldt (1 Oct - 8 Nov) cost 6,000+ casualties.
* Antwerp was the primary port that supplied the Allied offensive.

---

## Road to The Netherlands: Rhine

* Feb & March 45 saw a major push to drive Gr. across the Rhine
* In late March 1945, Canadian troops crossed the Rhine River.
* Rather than continue into Gr., Canadians moved north, to clear the Netherlands, the coast of Germany, and western Holland.

---

## The End in Europe

* Early April, Canadian Troops enter the Netherlands.
* Conditions were especially bad, people were starving to death.
* Canadians were greeted enthusiastically by the liberated Dutch
* 5 May: Canadian Generals accepted the surrender of German armies in their sectors.
* 7 May: Germany surrendered.
