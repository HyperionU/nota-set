# Lesson 1: Causes of World War II

---

## Main Causes of WWII

Three main causes pinpoint the reason that the world divulged into war.

1) ### Treaty of Versailles
2) ### Rise of Fascism
3) ### League of Nations

---

## Treaty of Versailles

* Germany resented the terms of the treaty
    * War Guilt Clause: "Germany is fully responsible for instigating WWI."
    * Reparations Clause: "Germany must pay $33 Billion in reparations to the Allies."
* Terms were far too 'harsh'
* Hitler ignored the treaty (conscripted men into army)

---

## Rise of Fascism

* Mussolini in Italy
* Hitler in Germany
    * Resentful over loss of national pride
    * Great Depression - Germany reduced into poor financial state.
* $\therefore$ Fascist / Violent leaders took power easily
"A light in darkness of depression"

---

## Failure of the League of Nations

* Founded after WWI to preserve world peace.
* Lack of cooperation
    * Japan / China
    * Hitler (Germany)
    * Mussolini (Italy)
* No back-up military force
* US didn't join (minimal influence)
