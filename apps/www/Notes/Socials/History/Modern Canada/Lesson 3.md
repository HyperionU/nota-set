## Clark's Collapse

* 1979: an election year, people wanted change.
* Led by Joe Clark, a Conservative minority gov't was elected.
* But, Clark tried a bold budget to raise taxes and cut spending.
* The budget was defeated. Clark's gov't collapsed after only 9 months.

## Trudeau's Return

* 1980: Trudeau returned with a majority gov't. The National Energy Program (NEP) was introduced.
* The NEP promoted oil self-sufficiency & 50% Canadian ownership by 1990.
* It established a Crown Corporation: Petro-Canada (*Yep, Petro-Canada was formerly owned by the gov't. I didn't believe it at first as well.*)
* It increased taxes on exports & set price controls on oil prices.

---

## The NEP

* There was one problem: The NEP benefited central Canada, but hurt western Canada. (*You know, where all the Canadian oil comes from?*)
* Trudeau deeply angered and alienated western Canada.

* A last minute compromise was made with the English Provinces.
* Quebec refused to accept the deal.
* Trudeau moved ahead without Quebec.
* May, 1982: The Queen proclaimed the Constitution Act of 1882.
* Quebec's refusal will result in future problems.

## Foreign Affairs (1969-'83)

* Trudeau stated that our foreign policy would become "the extension abroad of national policies."
* Trudeau was concerned about American influence on Canada.
> *"Living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant. No matter how friendly & even-tempered is the beast, if I can call it that, one is affected by every twitch & grunt."*

## International Conduct ('68-'69)

* 1968: Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommuniations Commission (CRTC) established.
