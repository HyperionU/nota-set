---

## The October Crisis: The 12 Days

* 5 Oct, 1970: The FLQ kidnaps British Trade Commissioner, James Cross
* 15 Oct: FLQ kidnaps Quebec Minister of Labour Pierre Laporte.
* The FLQ demanded the release of imprisoned members ("political prisoners") & the broadcasting of their manifesto (was read on Radio-Canada).
* Premier Robert Bourassa asks Trudeau for help.

## October Crisis: Canada Strikes

* 12 Oct, 1970: Armed Forces deployed to guard federal buildings & FLQ targets in Ottawa & Montreal
* 13 Oct: Trudeau is asked by a reporter, "How far are you going to go?" to which Trudeau replied "Well, just watch me!"
* 16 Oct: Trudeau invokes the War Measures Act, suspending civil liberties & individual rights.

---

## A Means to An End: October Crisis

* The War Measures Act allowed Police to jail people w/o charges & search homes w/o a warrant; 
    * 465 Canadians were arrested as a result.
* 17 Oct, 1970: Pierre Laporte's body is found dead in a car's trunk.
* Dec, 1970: Police find James Cross and his captors were given safe passage to Cuba.

## The Result

* Pierre Laporte's kidnappers were found, tried & convicted of kidnapping & murder.
* The War Measures Act has never before been used in peacetime, and the need for it is still debated today.
* Eventually, the War Measures Act became the Emergencies Act.
* The crisis tarnished all seperatist movements in Quebec, but they were still looking for change...
