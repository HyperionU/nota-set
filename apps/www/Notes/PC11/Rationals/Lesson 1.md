## Lesson 1: Rational Expressions Basics

---

## What is a Rational Expression? Part 1

* A **Rational number** is any number that can be expressed as a ratio ($\frac{p}{q}$) of two integers: $p$ and $q$, where $q\neq0$ ($q$ is non-zero).
    * Example: $7\frac{1}{2},2.5,\frac{-3}{2}\in\mathbb{Q}$
* An **expression** is  a mathematical phrase containing numbers, variables and operators (polynomials)
    * Example: $2x^2-1,2x^5-x^3+9x,\frac{1}{2}y+2x$.

---

## What is a Rational Expression? Part 2

* A **Rational Expression** is nothing more than a ratio where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials
* They must also follow the same rules which govern fractions.
    * LCD ($+/-$)
    * Answer in lowest terms (Simplify)
    * Cross Cancel ($*$)
    * Kiss & Flip ($\div$)

---

## Simplifying Rational Expressions, Part 1

* Ex. $\frac{12x^3y}{15x^2y^2}$
    * $\frac{3}{3}*\frac{4xy^{-1}}{5}$
    * $\frac{4x}{5y}$

* When we simplify, we break the numerator and denominator into base components and determining what "cancels out". This works for both basic fractions & rational expressions.

---

## Simplifying Rational Expressions, Part 2

* Simplifying works with more complicated scenarios as well:
    * $\frac{x(y-1)}{(y-1)(y+3)}$
    * $\frac{x}{y+3}$
* Even when dealing with larger terms (or brackets), same rules apply.
* We may need to modify our questions however.

---

## Simplifying Rational Expressions, Part 3

* Take this example: $\frac{c-8}{c^2-13c+40}$. Here's how to solve:
1) Factor
    * $\frac{c-8}{(c-8)(c-5)}$
2) Cancel
    * $\frac{}{c-5}$
3) Clean
    * $\frac{1}{c-5}$

---

## Edge Values

* Look at the graph of $\frac{1}{x+2}$.
* There's something strange at $x=-2$, there's an invisible line where the graph is undefined.
* This is called a Vertical Asymptote. Why is it where it is?
* If we substitute $x=-2$ into $\frac{1}{x+2}$, we get $\frac{1}{0}$.
* Since $\frac{1}{0}$ is undefined, we say it's a **Non-Permissable Value (NPV)**.
* When dealing with Rationals, we have to check for these NPVs, as they do not exist.

---

## Toeing the Edge: Finding NPVs

* To find NPVs, we only need to check the denominators.
* Examples:
    * $\frac{3}{x-6}, x-6=0, x\neq6$
    * $\frac{x+1}{4}, 4\neq0, \text{ No NPVs.}$
    * $\frac{2(x-3)}{(x-4)(3x+8)}, x-4=0,3x+8=0, x\neq\{4,\frac{-8}{3}\}$

* When looking at NPVs, they can appear at **ALL** steps of solving. If an NPV is possible, we **MUST** report them.

---

## Example A: Rationals & NPVs

* State the NPV(s) and Simplify:
    * $\frac{2x^2-5x-3}{4x^2+12x+5}$

1) Factor
   * $\frac{(2x+1)(x-3)}{(2x+1)(2x+5)}$
2) State NPVs
    * $2x+1\neq0,2x+5\neq0$
    * $x\neq-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$

---

## Example A, Cont.

3) Simplify:
    * $\frac{(2x+1)(x-3)}{(2x+1)(2x+5)}$
    * $\frac{2x+1}{2x+1}*\frac{x-3}{2x+5}$

$\frac{x-3}{2x+5}, x\neq-\frac{5}{2},-\frac{1}{2}$
