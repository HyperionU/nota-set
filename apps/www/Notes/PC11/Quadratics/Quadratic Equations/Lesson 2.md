## Lesson 2: Solving Quadratics - Graphing

---

## Terminology

* x-intercept(s) / Roots / Zeros: where the function crosses the x-axis ($y=0$).
* Solving: finding the roots / zeros
---

## Intro

* When solving a quadratic using a graph, it's just a matter of looking where the parabola crosses the x-axis.
* *Note:* Just because the values appear correct, take any values w/ a grain of salt, until you verify them.
* To verify: substitute both suspected answers in the equation and check if both sides balance.

---

## Possible Results

* There are 3 possible situations you can answer.

1) **2** Real Roots: The function crosses the x-axis twice in two distinctive places.
2) **1** Real Root: The function crosses the x-axis in one distinct place. (often, the vertex is the root in this case)
3) **0** Real Roots: The function doesn't cross the x-axis in the real plane. ($x\in\mathbb C$).
