# Lesson 6: Road to War

---

## Appeasement

* Sudden rise of dictatorships was a concern, little could be done
* Citizens scared to speak out, as secret police and informers result in a person's "disappearance"
* All countries were economically weak, not prepared to fight a war.
* Countries interested in managing peace, rather than taking stands.

---

## 1935: Appeasement

* Italy invades **Abyssinia** (modern day Ethiopia)
* League of Nations imposes sanctions, but not on oil
* Not all members supported sanctions
* Later, the League suggests a plan that gives 2/3 of Abyssinia to Italy.
* Secretly Britain & France agree: let Italy have Abyssinia
* A **major** failure of the league.
* Indication to Hitler that the world wasn't ready to oppose him!

---

## 1938: Appeasement

* Hiter demanded to take over the Sudetenland, a German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia
* September, at the **Munich Conference**, leaders of Britain & France met with Hitler.
* Hitler promised this would be his last territorial demand.
* British PM Neville Chamberlain returned to London proclaiming he secured "Peace for our time."
* Hitler thought Chamberlain was a push-over, appeasement only encouraged him!

## Hitler's Progression

* Germany, according to the Treaty of Versailles:
    * restricted from having a significant army,
    * Rhineland (western segment) was disarmed,
    * was not allowed to unite with Austria.
* Unfortunately, Hitler wanted to expand Germany's borders to create "Living Space" (Lebensraum)
* He risked war, but successfully judged the timing of his actions & reactions of others.
* He finally guessed wrong in 1939.
* Britain threatened war if Germany invaded Poland.
