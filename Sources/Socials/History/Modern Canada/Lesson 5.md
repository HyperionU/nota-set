## The '93 Election

* Kim Campbell started the campaign in the lead, but would suffer the largest defeat in Canadian history.
* Two things sank the Conservative's Chances:
    1. Liberal's publication of "The Red Book", a detailed platform outline earlier than expected.
    2. Conservatives ran a negative ad making fun of Chrétien's partial paralysis in his face.
    * Support basically evaporated.
