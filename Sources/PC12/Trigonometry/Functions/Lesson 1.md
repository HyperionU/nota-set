# Lesson 1: Radians

---

## Right Triangle Trig

![bg left fit invert](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/right-triangle-trigonometry.jpg)

This is right angle trig.
* SOHCAHTOA
    * $\sin{\theta} = \frac{O}{H}$
    * $\cos{\theta} = \frac{A}{H}$
    * $\tan{\theta} = \frac{O}{A}$
* $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

---

## Reciprocity

Each trig ratio has a reciprocal:

* $\csc{\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin{\theta}} = \frac{H}{O}$
* $\sec{\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos{\theta}} = \frac{H}{A}$
* $\cot{\theta} = \frac{1}{\tan{\theta}} = \frac{A}{O}$

## Angles Units

Previously, we have measured angle size in degrees ($x^{\circ}$).
Now, we'll measure them in radians $x_R$.

1 Radian: the measure of the angle formed by an arc length equal to the radius.

* How big is this? Let's see:
$$
    \frac{r}{2\pi r} \propto \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}
$$

---

## Calculating 1 radian

How big is 1 radian?

$$
    \frac{r}{2\pi r} \propto \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 
$$

$$
    \frac{360\not r}{\not 2\pi \not r} = \theta
$$

$$
    \frac{180}{\pi} = \theta
$$

$\theta \approx 57^\circ = 1 \text{ rad}$.

## Radians

* How many radian would fit halfway around a circle? $\pi$
* Then, how many would fit around the circle? $2\pi$

---

## Conversion

* First, you should be able to convert between radians and degrees.
* Where we start: $\pi \text{ rad} = 180^\circ$

Degrees to Radians:
* $120^\circ$
    * $120^\circ \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}$
    * $\frac{12\pi}{18} = \frac{2\pi}{3}$

---

## Conversion, cont.

Radians to Degrees:
* $\frac{3\pi}{4}$
    * $\frac{3\not\pi}{\not 4} \cdot \frac{180}{\not\pi}$
    * $3 \cdot 45$
    * $135^\circ$

## Review

* Math 10: Right Angle Trig
* PC11: Triangle Trig $\to$ Coordinate Trig
* PC12: Signed Coordinate Trig, Radians

---

## Standard Position

* Angle that follows these rules:
    * Vertex at $(0, 0)$
    * Initial arm on $x^+$-axis
    * $\text{sign}(\theta) =$ direction

---

## Co-terminal angles

*Hope you like spirals!*

* Angles w/ same terminal arm
* Smallest $+$'ve coterminal angle is the Principal.
* To find all angles:
    * $\theta \pm 360n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $\theta + 360n, n \in \mathbb{Z}$
    * $\theta \pm 2\pi n, n \in \mathbb{N}$ or $\theta + 2\pi n, n \in \mathbb{Z}$

---

## Determining Arclength

* Determine the arclength of a circle w/ $r = 3, \theta = 2.1$ (no units means radians.)
$$
    \frac{a}{6\pi} = \frac{2.1}{2\pi}
$$

$$
    a = 3 \cdot 2.1 = 6.3\text{ m}
$$

* How about a general solution?

$$
    \frac{a}{2\pi r} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi}
$$

$a = r\theta$

## Measuring angles

There are 4 ways to measure angles:

1. Revolutions (rev) $1 \text{ rev} = 360^\circ$ or $2\pi$
2. Degrees ($^\circ$)
    * mins & sec ($^\circ, ', ''$)
3. Radians (rad, r, no units)
4. Gradians (grad), mostly used for construction
