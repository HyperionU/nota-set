# Lesson 2: Reflections

---

## What are Reflections?

* A transformation where points on the original graph have an image resulting in a reflection along a line.
* Shape doesn't change, but orientation might.

---

## Vertical Reflections

* Defined as:

$y = f(x) \mapsto y = -f(x)$ or $-y = f(x)$

* x-coordinate is identical ($x$)
* y-coordinate is inverted ($-y$)
* Distance from the x-axis is identical, just on the other side.
* Mapping Notation: $(x,y) \mapsto (x,-y)$

---

## Example: Vertical Reflection
Given a function $y = f(x)$, graph $y = -f(x)$.

Mapping Points:

|   | $y = f(x)$ | $y = -f(x)$ |
|---|------------|-------------|
| A | $(-4,-2)$  |   $(-4,2)$  |
| B | $(-2,-2)$  |   $(-2,2)$  |
| C |  $(1,0)$   |   $(1,0)$   |
| D |  $(2,3)$   |   $(2,-3)$  |
| E |  $(3,-2)$  |   $(3,2)$   |

---

## On Invariant Points

* Points that remain unchanged after a transformation.
    * In this case, any point on the x-axis.
* Example: in the previous example, $C \mapsto C$

---

## Horizontal Reflections

* Defined as:

$y = f(x) \mapsto y = f(-x)$

* x-coordinate is inverted ($-x$)
* y-coordinate is identical ($y$)
* Distance from the y-axis is identical, just on the other side.
* Mapping Notation: $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,y)$

---

## Example: Horizontal Reflection
Given a function $y = f(x)$, graph $y = f(-x)$.

Mapping Points:

|   | $y = f(x)$ | $y = -f(x)$ |
|---|------------|-------------|
| A | $(-4,-2)$  |   $(4,-2)$  |
| B | $(-2,-2)$  |   $(2,-2)$  |
| C |  $(1,0)$   |   $(-1,0)$  |
| D |  $(2,3)$   |   $(-2,3)$  |
| E |  $(3,-2)$  |  $(-3,-2)$  |

---

## Invariant Points

* For this example: All points on the y-axis are invariant.
* The only invariant point in the previous function is the y-intercept $(0, -\frac{3}{4})$

---

## Practice:
What would the following functions look like if they were reflected in the:
- y-axis?
    * $y = \frac{1}{x^2 - 3x}$
    * $y = x^3 - 3x^2$
- x-axis?
    * $y = \log x$
    * $y = \sqrt{3x - 1} + 6$

---

## Answers:

- y-axis:
    * $y = \frac{1}{x^2 + 3x}$
    * $y = -(x^3 - 3x^2)$
- x-axis:
    * $y = -\log x$
    * $y = -\sqrt{3x - 1} - 6$

---

## Note:

* Now, we can translate and reflect graphs.
* It gets more complicated from here.
